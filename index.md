# Bio

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hi! I am a computer vision researcher with B.E. mathmatics at Northwestern Polytechnical University from Xi'an, China.

I just left from Xi'an GraphLight Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. at 2024.3. Previously I led a computer vision team at a startup company which aims to develop (subway) Rail Inspection Vehicles since 2020.6 to 2023.11.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Mathematics Department at the University of Northwestern Polytechnical (NPU) in Xi'an, China, in June 2007. After that, I pursued my postgraduate studies starting from September 2008 and became a PhD student in the School of Mechanical Engineering at NPU in September 2010. I completed my studies at NPU in December 2019. During my time there, I had three papers published, one in Chinese and two in English.

Now I am living in Xi'an City of China and i 'm looking for remote jobs.
